We had a very successfull bookclub last week to kick off the new term! 
Andrew was our first speaker with an introduction to Assembley. We learnt about how programming in Assembley can be beneficial if you want to have more control over memory and storage locations and can be more efficient as the code is closer to the machine language that can be directly read by the computer. However this comes at a price as it is a lot more invoved to code than the high-level languages, such as python, that we are used too. We also now fully appreciate how difficult it would be to program in binary! For those who want to learn more Andrew's notes can be found at [andrewblance.github.io](andrewblance.github.io). In his words "It's fun, but maybe I'm a nerd." Well aren't we all really!

Second up was yours truely with a rather less polished introduction to C++. This went through the first chapter of ***C++ Primer 5th Edition***, by Stanley B. Lippman, Josee Lajoie and Barbara E. Moo. We learnt how to write a simle program to take a file with books stored as ***ISBN- no.copies sold- price*** and return the total number of a particular book sold, the total revenue from that book and the average selling price. This involved a first look at while loops, if statements and classes in c++. Notes and code material can be found at [https://github.com/ptgregg/bookclub](https://github.com/ptgregg/bookclub).

To round off the session Dorian gave us an introduction to ***The 7 Habits of Highly effective people***, by Stephen R. Covey. We were led through the thought and philosophy behind the book to enable us to be in the right frame of mind for the preceding weeks. Dorian explained how the book differs from others on similar topics, in that it focuses on change coming from a deeper place within you rather than just a change of behaviour on the surface. The main idea being to think about what your prinicples and decide how to behave in accordance with them; thus aiming to be true to yourself. 

We look forward to continuing next week, which will be made even better with the addition of Joe talking about Roger Penrose's book, ***The road to reality***.
